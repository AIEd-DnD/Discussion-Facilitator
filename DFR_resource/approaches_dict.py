    "Narrative Approach":"Students are guided to identify and clarify their personal beliefs and values when they relate their personal experiences, construct their own stories or consider the experiences of others. Teachers use the questioning process to help students take perspectives, clarify their feelings and reflect on how they can apply their learning to their daily lives. Through this, students understand the need to practise good values, and learn how they are expressed through concrete actions.", 
    "Experiential Approach":"Students go through a cycle of experiences, observation, reflection and application in real-world situations or scenarios to help them internalise the values. Teachers facilitate dialogue and sharing of personal experiences to help students reflect on the values, skills and attitudes learnt, and suggest how they can be applied in their daily lives.",
    "Consideration Approach":"Through effective questioning, teachers help students examine at issues from different perspectives. By considering the impact of one's decisions on others, they learn to be more sensitive to the feelings of others. This helps to develop in them the capacity for empathy, and an ability to make sound decisions based on a balanced understanding of any situation.",
    "Cognitive Development Approach":"Students are brought through the process of moral reasoning to help them examine the motives behind their actions, and consider common good when deciding on the right thing to do. Teachers use the questioning process to help students progress from a self-centred perspective to a higher level of moral reasoning focusing on societal and universal perspectives using Kohlberg's six stages of moral development.",
    "Modified Values Approach":"Teachers use the questioning process to guide students to clarify their beliefs and values through examining their personal feelings, Uuderstanding the values and beliefs held by others and considering the impact of their actions on others. In this way, students are better able to make informed and responsible decisions based on a sound value system."

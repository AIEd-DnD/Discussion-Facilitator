This repository contains the code for the Discussion Facilitator Prototype built for the first run of AI Bootcamp in 2024.

It contains two versions of the application: a command line version "main_cmd.py", and a streamlit version "main_st.py". 

The AIEd DnD team should continue to use this repository to test out LEA ideas and concepts.
